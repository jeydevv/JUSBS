# JUSBS
## In Go
JUSBS is a very simple USB Security program with a server and a client.

The server must be up when the usb is plugged in (If autorun is setup) or the program is launched.

The client will send some core data of the PC that the USB is plugged into. Feel free to use the code in any way.
However, I am not responsible for what you do with it.

Personally, I have it set up with all files except 'UnlockUSB.exe' hidden (not suspicious, I know), this way anyone who is not me who tries to access it will send me some of their PC's data. You can also use it to get simple data on the PC's that you use often.

For more information look at the code. **WARNING** This data is raw text over TCP/IP, it is NOT secure OR encrypted!

Enjoy, thanks!
